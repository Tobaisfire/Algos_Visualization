# Demystifying Sorting Algorithms: An Interactive Visual Journey

In the world of computer science, sorting algorithms are fundamental building blocks that every programmer should understand. But let's face it: reading about sorting algorithms can be, well, a bit dry. That's why I decided to bring these algorithms to life with an interactive visualization tool. Let me take you on a colorful journey through the world of sorting!

Technology :  Python

Libraries : Pygame  https://www.pygame.org/news

## The Project: Multi-Algorithm Sorting Visualization

I've created a Python application using Pygame that visualizes four classic sorting algorithms side by side:

1. Bubble Sort          https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort-algorithm/
2. Selection Sort      https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selection-sort-algorithm-2/
3. Insertion Sort       https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort-algorithm/
4. Merge Sort           https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/

But this isn't just any visualization - it's an interactive, color-coded experience that helps you understand exactly what's happening at each step of the sorting process.
